Soumi Dutta, Vibhash Chandra, Kanav Mehra, Asit Kumar Das, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Saptarshi Ghosh. Ensemble Algorithms for Microblog Summarization. IEEE Intelligent Systems, Special Issue on Summarization of Things, vol. 33, no. 3, pp. 4--14, May/June 2018. 


* This folder contains, apart from this README file, the following:

+ Folder "input_datasets" containing four text files, giving the four tweet datasets used in the paper:
(1) hblast_input_data.txt - 1413 distinct tweets related to Bomb blasts in Hyderabad, India
(2) hagupit_input_data.txt - 1461 distinct tweets related to Typhoon Hagupit in Phillipines
(3) uflood_input_data.txt - 2069 distinct tweets related to Floods in Uttaranchal state of India
(4) sandyhook_input_data.txt - 2080 distinct tweets related to Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in USA

As specified in the paper, three human annotators were asked to independently summarize each of the four datasets.

+ Folder "gold-standard-summaries" containing three sub-folders "annotator1", "annotator2", and "annotator3". The sub-folder "annotator1" contains four text files, giving the gold standard summaries (extractive) for the four datasets generated by Annotator 1. Similarly the sub-folders "annotator2" and "annotator3" respectively contain the gold standard summaries generated by Annotator 2 and Annotator 3. The dataset for which a particular file contains a gold standard summary should be evident from the name of the file. 


* Each file in both the folders mentioned above contains the text of one tweet per line.
